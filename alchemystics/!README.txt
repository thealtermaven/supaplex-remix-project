The Remix Project

an Alchemystics Design Project

LIST OF LEVELS CONTRIBUTED BY
ALTERMAVEN OF ALCHEMYSTICS DESIGN

kaizo means "rearranged"! this does not mean the
levels are extremently difficult, but expect
things to be extra tedious! IT'S A REMIX!

REGARDING TIMELIMIT: some levels have a fuse that can lit and
destroy a dumb murphy. The time limit is measured in frames and
it determines how long it takes for the fuse to kill the dumb murphy.
Default Supaplex is 35 frames per second, time approximations are
based on that framerate!
