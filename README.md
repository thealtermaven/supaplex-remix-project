# supaplex-remix-project
Remix Project collaboration for classic Boulder Dash, Levelset 10, "Promotek" and "Aftermath" for Supaplex.

Playing these levels requires the Supaplex Speedfix 6.3 patch for DOSBox Supaplex, or for Windows 7/10, you can also use OpenSupaplex or Megaplex. Commercial ports are unspported. I will not help you play these sets using a commercial port which may be inaccurate for the tricks required.

Levelsets will become available every 111 contributed levels. Directories are sorted by individual contributor.

To grab:
* Click "Code" then "Save as ZIP".
* Extract the contents of the ZIP into a folder that can be accessed by the above programs.

To open the .SP levels for play using SpeedFix 6.3:
+ `SPEEDFIX63.EXE :level.sp` where "level.sp" is the level you want to attempt. Colon must be intact.

To open the .SP levels for play using OpenSupaplex:
+ `OpenSupaplex.exe -p level.sp` where "level.sp" is the level you want to attempt. Restart with F12

To open using Megaplex:
+ File, "Open", then browse to directory with the .sp files you want to play. Choose a file and hit Open.
+ This has the extra benefit of having the other .sp files listed in the levelset selection menu.
+ Visual Basic 6.0 Runtimes are required to open and use Megaplex. This can be found on the Microsfot website

To open levelsets using Speedfix 6.3/OpenSupaplex:
+ rename "levels.dat" and "levels.lst" to ".D??" and ".L??" respectively, where "??" is a number not used
+ You can also use levels.dat and levels.lst directly; move the old levels.dat and levels.lst to a directory that you can access so you can replace them in the event you want to play the prior set again. This may cause strange behaviour with the player list. I do not recommend.
+ To access all the levels at once, use the # commandline switch for SpeedFix 6.3 and "-t" switch for OpenSupaplex.

To open levelsets using Megaplex:
+ File, "Open", then browse to the directory with the levels.dat file you wish to play. Select and hit Open.
+ You can access the levels present in the list.
+ You don't need to move "levels.dat"/"level.lst" to the Supaplex directory.
